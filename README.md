# My-Portfolio-Web-Server
Hi! I'm Antonio Urdaneta, and this is a simple Flask-based web server I created to host my personal portfolio webpage. The server is defined in the server.py file, and it renders the index.html template when you visit the site. This page showcases my professional information, including links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email.
